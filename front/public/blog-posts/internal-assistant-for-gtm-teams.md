An **internal assistant** trained on your company’s docs can transform how Go-To-Market (**GTM**) teams work. With **CrawlChat**, that knowledge becomes fast, accurate, and permission-aware—right where teams operate. As a polished **gtm internal assistant**, it meets reps in their daily workflows.

> The right answer, in the right place, at the right time.

## Benefits for GTM

- **Faster onboarding:** Instant answers on _ICP_, messaging, and pricing speed up ramp.
- **Consistent messaging:** Everyone uses the latest talk tracks and collateral.
- **Shorter cycles:** Quick access to technical, security, and legal guidance removes bottlenecks.
- **Fewer interrupts and errors:** Self-serve answers reduce SME pings and version drift.
- **Governance and compliance:** Role-based access and approvals protect sensitive info.
- **Measurable impact:** Track deflection, time saved, and freshness SLAs to prove ROI.

These outcomes set the stage for how **CrawlChat** plugs in and scales across **gtm** teams.

## How CrawlChat Helps

- **Unified ingestion:** Connect [Notion](https://docs.crawlchat.app/knowledge-base/notion), [Confluence](https://docs.crawlchat.app/knowledge-base/confluence-pages), and more into Knowledge Groups; auto-sync and ignore outdated pages.
- **Permission-aware answers:** Respect source permissions and roles so the right people see the right guidance.
- **In the flow of work:** Ask questions in [Slack](https://docs.crawlchat.app/connect/slack-app)/[Discord](https://docs.crawlchat.app/connect/discord-bot) or surface answers on the web via the _Ask AI_ widget.
- **Consistency at scale:** Pin “sources of truth” so approved materials are prioritized everywhere.
- **Launch readiness:** Centralize launch plans and FAQs; the assistant routes teams to what’s new and relevant.
- **Analytics and governance:** Measure deflection and freshness, alert owners, and streamline approvals.

Together, these capabilities power your **gtm internal assistant** at scale.

## Connectors: Notion, Confluence, Linear

**CrawlChat**’s native connectors import and sync documentation from multiple teams into one reliable **gtm internal assistant**.

- **[Notion](https://docs.crawlchat.app/knowledge-base/notion):** Connect private pages via a Notion API token; auto-sync and exclude off-scope pages from Knowledge Group settings.
- **[Confluence](https://docs.crawlchat.app/knowledge-base/confluence-pages):** Connect your instance with Email, Host URL, and API key; select or exclude pages and set auto-update cadence.
- **[Linear](https://docs.crawlchat.app/knowledge-base/linear-issues):** Import issues and projects with a Linear API key; auto-syncs the latest 250 issues and 250 projects with optional status filters.
- **Built for scale:** Map each source to the right Knowledge Groups or Private collections, and keep content fresh with ignore lists and schedules.

> If it’s documented, it’s discoverable.

Now that content is in, **gtm** teams need secure, focused places to use it.

## Private Channels

Run the **gtm internal assistant** inside specific [Slack](https://docs.crawlchat.app/connect/slack-app) or [Discord](https://docs.crawlchat.app/connect/discord-bot) channels so teams can work with sensitive guidance without creating noise.

- **What they are:** Team-, segment-, or region-specific channels where users @mention the **CrawlChat** bot for instant, cited answers.
- **Why they help:** Keep pricing guardrails, competitive tactics, and launch plans with the right audiences; cut cross-team chatter.
- **Setup basics:** Add the bot, reply in threads for cleaner channels, and align channel membership with content sensitivity.
- **Transparency and control:** Answers cite sources; membership gates access; analytics highlight repeated questions and gaps.

To further tailor access and precision, pair channels with **Private collections**.

## Private Collections

Organize and protect sensitive **gtm** knowledge while keeping it instantly searchable for the right people and surfaces—fuel for your **gtm internal assistant**.

- **What they are:** Collections grouping sources by function, region, segment, or program across websites, files, [Notion](https://docs.crawlchat.app/knowledge-base/notion), [Confluence](https://docs.crawlchat.app/knowledge-base/confluence-pages), GitHub issues, and more.
- **Why they help:** Isolate confidential guidance; ensure reps pull the approved, current materials; narrow retrieval to the most relevant content first.
- **Access and privacy:** Link collections to private channels so only intended audiences can query them; use workspace and channel privacy to control exposure.
- **Quality and freshness:** Monitor conversations and performance to find gaps; update sources so the assistant improves continuously.
- **GTM examples:** Sales Playbooks, Competitive Intel, Pricing & Policy, Launch Center, Partner Desk.
- **Best practices:** Map each collection to its channels, pin authoritative sources, review analytics monthly, and archive stale content on a schedule.
