You can enable support ticket module on demand for any collection. Once enabled, there are two ways that the user can create Support Ticket from the chatbot

- Whenver the chatbot answers a question it prompts the user if the query is resolved. If they chose NO, it shows a form which takes title, description, and email so that it can create a support ticket
- The second way is, the chatbot itself shows the support ticket creation form whenever it has no answer from the knowledge base. It auto fills the title and descriptions. The user can just enter the email so that the support ticket gets created

Once the support ticket is created, you can manage them from Tickets page on the dashboard. The users gets all the updates such as new messages and resolution on their email. The ticket can be accessed only from an unique link wich is only sent to the user, so it is pretty secured as well.
