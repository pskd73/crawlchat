CrawlChat now automatically detects and tracks the language of each question asked by your users. This helps you understand your audience better and identify which languages your documentation might need to support.

- Language is automatically detected for every question
- View the detected language on each question's detail page
- See a breakdown of all languages used in a pie chart on the **Summary** page
- Identify opportunities to add documentation in other languages based on user demand
