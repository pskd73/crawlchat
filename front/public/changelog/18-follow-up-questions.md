Now the web chat widget shows follow up questions under the recent answer. It generates a maximum of 3 follow up questions based on the recent relevent questions asked, the conversations itself, and the latest messages.

If the **support tickets** module is enabled, it also shows **I want to create a support ticket** follow up question so that the users can intuitevely create support tickets on demand.

This feature is available only for paid customers currently.
