Released the teams feature on CrawlChat. You can now invite your team members and build the knowledge base and chatbot together. The collection carries the credits and limits of the owner. You can invite your team member by their email and they get added with **member** role where as the owner would have **owner** role.

The members can pretty much do everything except deleting the collection and removing other members (this will be revisited in next releases). Please check your plan and limits for creating collections and inviting new members.
