You can now connect your private **Notion** pages as knowledge source on CrawlChat and keep it sync with the pages all the time. You need to create an API token on Notion to make it work. The entire guide for setting it up is [here](https://guides.crawlchat.app/guide/crawlchat-knowledge-groups-integrating-notion-pages-37)

Once you have setup the *Knowledge Group*, you can configure the pages to ignore and auto update from the knowledge group setting page.
