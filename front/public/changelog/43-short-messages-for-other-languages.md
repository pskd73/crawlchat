Added **Short Questions** to make question summaries easier to scan at a glance, especially when conversations include multiple languages.

This helps you quickly understand what a user is asking, even if the original question is in another language:

- get a compact summary without reading a long full message
- identify intent faster when triaging questions
- review multilingual conversations more efficiently
- reduce back-and-forth
