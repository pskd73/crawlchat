Added **Tooltip** option for the Ask AI button you embed on your webpage. This shows on top of the Ask AI button always. It is helpful to prompt the user that they can use the Ask AI button for resolving their queries. You can customise the text from the [**Customise widget**](https://crawlchat.app/integrations#customise-widget) section.
