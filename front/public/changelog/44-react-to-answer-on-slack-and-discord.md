You can now ask CrawlChat to answer a message by reaction. It is very helpful when you someone asks a question and you know that the CrawlChat bot can answer it.

- React with 💬 to a message
- The bot picks up that message as the prompt and replies in context
- This makes quick follow-ups easier in busy channels and threads
- Works on both Slack and Discord
