# Data Privacy & Security Policy

1. **Data Storage**  
   Information provided by users and ingested into the CrawlChat Knowledge Base is securely stored within CrawlChat-managed databases.  

2. **Data Usage for Responses**  
   CrawlChat only transmits relevant portions of the stored information to Large Language Models (LLMs) when generating answers.  

3. **No Secondary Use**  
   CrawlChat does not reuse, repurpose, or exploit the stored information for any purpose other than enabling responses requested by users.  

4. **Third-Party Model Privacy**  
   According to [OpenAI’s Privacy Policy](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance#h_0a0de9d131), information passed to OpenAI’s LLMs is not used for training or improving their models.  

5. **Access Control**  
   CrawlChat provides visibility settings to ensure confidentiality. We strongly recommend setting collections to **Private**, such that only designated channels (e.g., Slack channels for TrustWorks) may access the information. Visibility settings can be managed at: [https://crawlchat.app/settings#visibility-type](https://crawlchat.app/settings#visibility-type).  

6. **Data Retention & Deletion**  
   - Stored messages older than **30 days** are automatically purged every **3 months**.  
   - If a knowledge group or collection is deleted, all associated information is **permanently removed** from CrawlChat’s databases.
